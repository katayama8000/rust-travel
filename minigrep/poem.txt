All I wanted is to be with you.
But you left me alone.

I wanted to be with you.
But you left me alone.

I was messed up.
I was confused.
I was lost.
I was broken.
I was hopeless.
I was depressed.
I was suicidal.

you made me feel all of those things.

Now, I'm trying to move on.
I'm trying to be happy.
